# GINR
This is the implementation of Generative implicit neural representation.
We plan to train functa/mnif/mod-inr as backbone representation for image, point cloud, and nerf.
The latents are generated by lnvae.

# TODO
- [ ] Implement data loading module
- [ ] Define the architecture of the backbone representation
- [ ] Implement training loop for functa/mnif/mod-inr
- [ ] Implement lnvae for generating latents
- [ ] Test the model on image, point cloud, and nerf datasets
- [ ] Optimize the model for better performance
- [ ] Write documentation and comments for the code
- [ ] Refactor and clean up the code
